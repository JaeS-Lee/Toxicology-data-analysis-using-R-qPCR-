# Toxicology data analysis using R (qPCR)

In our study, qPCR is widely used to investigate expression level of specific genes and validate RNA-Seq results.
Raw data we used is all preprocessed data using 2−ΔΔCT methods introduced by [Livak and Schmittgen (2001)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202301912629?via%3Dihub).
All example data showed in this section are all modified data, not our original data.
